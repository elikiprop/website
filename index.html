      <i> 1 JazzN!ghts is a famous Jazz festival, held in Zurich every year</i>.
      Since its first edition in <b>1986</b>,<em>
        it has gone through several major changes regarding its structure,
        length and location From this year on, the tickets will be sold in three
        distinct ways: traditionally, in electronic format directly on the
        festival website, and through SBB.</em

      <u
        >All parties will have access to the same unique tickets database of the
        new system, to avoid double selling.</u
      >
      A partnership with the SBB railway company needs to be set up, such that
      SBB can sell combi-tickets including both the festival admission fee and
      the train ride to the festival venue at reduced price.
    </p>

      Additionally, upon arrival at the festival venue, each participant has to
      self-check in at a touch screen terminal, which scans the barcodes on
      his/her ticket and issues a bracelet with an electronic chip. </a
    >This can be used to load money, such that whenever (s)he wants to purchase
    snacks or beverages,thus reducing waiting times.
